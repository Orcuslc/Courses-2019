\medskip

Since I do not have a specific problem related with my research right now, I think I would choose one of the example codes and make it parallel and/or use CUDA to employ GPU computing. The reason to choose this project is to gain a better command in parallel computing and CUDA for my future research, as well as to prepare for the HPC summer school in July. I haven't determined which example code to choose, so I wonder which one suit my case best.
